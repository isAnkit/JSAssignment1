       >> Answer

       <div class="code">
        const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
            if(a<1){
            return true;
            } else if(a>b){
            return true;

        <h2>3. Check the conditons</h2>

            You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:
            
            if both are divisible by 10 console true.
            if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
            if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
            Use operator to do this.

            <div class="code">
            const Check = (A, B) => 
        {
            if(A%10 === 0 && B%10 === 0){
                return true;
